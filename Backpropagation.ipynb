    "# Backpropagation\n",
    "\n",
    "Backpropagation is a method for efficiently computing the gradient of the cost function of a neural network with respect to its parameters.  These partial derivatives can then be used to update the network's parameters using, e.g., gradient descent.  This may be the most common method for training neural networks.  Deriving backpropagation involves numerous clever applications of the chain rule for functions of vectors.  For a somewhat more accessible and readable (but slightly less complete) tutorial which uses notation similar to this one, please see\n",
